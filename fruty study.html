        <h3>Tropical Fruits</h3>
        <p>Tropical fruits are fruits that grow in hot, humid climates typically found near the equator — like parts of Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and some Pacific islands. These fruits thrive in warm temperatures and usually can’t survive frost or cold weather. </p>
<br>
<p><h4>🍍Common Tropical Fruits</h4>
    Here are some popular tropical fruits and what makes them special:
    <br> <br> <br>
    
    Fruit	Highlights
    Mango	Juicy, sweet, and rich in Vitamin A and C. Great for the immune system.
    Pineapple	Contains bromelain, an enzyme that helps digestion. Sweet and tangy.
    Papaya	Packed with digestive enzymes and Vitamin C. Soft and sweet flesh.
    Banana	Energy-rich, high in potassium, and easy to digest.
    Coconut	Used for its water, milk, and oil. Refreshing and full of electrolytes.
    Guava	Loaded with fiber and antioxidants. Sweet-tart taste.
    Lychee	Juicy, floral-scented, and high in Vitamin C. A seasonal favorite.<br><br>
    <h4>🌞 Health Benefits</h4>
    Boosts immunity<br>
    
    Helps digestion<br>
    
    Hydrates and refreshes<br>
    
    Rich in essential vitamins and minerals
    <br>
    Great for energy and skin health
    <br>
    <h4>🌍 Fun Fact</h4>
    Many tropical fruits are enjoyed globally but are still grown mostly in tropical countries and exported to other parts of the world. That’s why they can be more expensive in colder regions!
    <br>
    Would you like me to add this as a section on your website — maybe under the Fruit Categories? Or build a separate page for Tropical Fruits with images and details?

        <h3>Citrus Fruits</h3>
       <br><br> <p><h4>🍊 What Are Citrus Fruits?</h4>
         <br>Citrus fruits are a group of juicy, zesty fruits known for their bright flavors, refreshing smell, and a boost of vitamin C. They usually grow on small trees or shrubs and have thick, bumpy peels and segments inside — kind of like little fruit puzzles!
          
         <br><br> <h4>🧃 Common Citrus Fruits</h4>
         <br>Orange – Sweet, juicy, and perfect for juice! 🍊
          
          Lemon – Sour and tangy. Great in water, tea, or even cleaning! 🍋
          
          Lime – Like a lemon’s little cousin, but with a sharper zing. 🍈
          
          Grapefruit – A mix of sweet and bitter. Some love it, some don’t! 🍇 (but not really a grape!)
          
          Mandarin – Easy to peel, sweet, and snack-sized! 🧡
          
          <br><br> <h4>🌞 Fun Facts About Citrus Fruits</h4>
          <br> They are loaded with Vitamin C, which helps your body fight off colds and boosts your immune system.
          
          Citrus fruits are believed to have originated in Asia thousands of years ago.
          
          Some oranges are used to make essential oils that smell amazing and are used in soaps and perfumes.
          
          The inside is juicy, but the outer zest (peel) can be used for flavoring desserts or drinks!
          
          <br><br><h4> 🍋 Why Citrus Fruits Are Good for You</h4>
          <br> Help keep your skin healthy and glowing
          
          Great for your immune system
          
          Some even help with digestion
          
          Super hydrating — like a snack and a drink in one!</p>
